# Sadboi

A discord bot that saves, loads, and plays playlists for Rythm and other audio bots using the "!" command. 
However, it still lacks the saving & loading features as it is in pre-alpha phase.

The bot currently uses "?" as a prefix.

(Bots using different prefixes require modification of files)


## **Current features & how to use them**:
1. Logging messages automatically (*Vague, and will be removed in future updates*)

2. Joining and leaving VC (*By using ?join & ?leave commands respectively*)

3. Playing playlists by typing "!play {NameofPlaylist}"  by iterating through sbdb.json for the song names in the specified playlist. (*By using ?playlist "NameofPlayList". Currently saved playlists are only placeholders for testing purposes*)

4. Clearing messages. Requires mod powers. (*By using ?clear {amount}. Default amount is 10. Will be removed in future updates*)

5. Repeating messages. (*By using ?echo {message}. Will be removed in future updates*)

## **Planned features**:
1. Create, save & modify playlists

2. Shuffle & play playlists

3. Remove playlists

Currently in pre-alpha phase, whatever that means :)))
