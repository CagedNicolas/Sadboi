# Sadboi

A discord bot that saves, loads, and plays playlists for Rythm and other audio bots using the "!" command. 
However, it still lacks the saving & loading features as it is in pre-alpha phase.

**You can use the `?help` command to know about all available commands**

The bot currently uses "?" as a prefix.

(Bots using different prefixes require modification of files)


## **Current features & how to use them**:
1. Logging messages automatically (*Vague, and will be removed in future updates*)

2. Joining and leaving VC (*By using ?join & ?leave commands respectively*)

3. Playing playlists by typing "!play {NameofPlaylist}"  by iterating through sbdb.json for the song names in the specified playlist. (*By using ?playlist "NameofPlayList". Currently saved playlists are only placeholders for testing purposes*)

4. Clearing messages. Requires mod powers. (*By using ?clear {amount}. Default amount is 10. Will be removed in future updates*)

5. Repeating messages. (*By using ?echo {message}. Will be removed in future updates*)

6. Adding & removing songs in playlists. (*By using ?addsong & ?rmsong respectively.*)

7. Viewing songs in playlists and all playlists. (*By using ?v **PlaylistName** & ?vpl respectively.*)

## **Planned features**:
1. Create & erase entire playlists.

2. Shuffle & play playlists.

3. Add error checking.

4. Save playlists from Rythm currently playing playlist.

Currently in **pre-alpha phase**
